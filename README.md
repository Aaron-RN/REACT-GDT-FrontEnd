## Setup for Local use

### Clone Repository

Grab a clone of [this repository](https://github.com/Aaron-RN/REACT-GDT-FrontEnd/tree/v1.0) from Github

### [Setting up Back-End](https://github.com/Aaron-RN/ROR-GDT-Assessment)

In order for this application to work you will also need to setup your back-end server. You can do so following this readme guide [here](https://github.com/Aaron-RN/ROR-GDT-Assessment).

### Setting up Front-End to Back-End connection

After you have successfully setup your back-end, you will need to change the URL the front-end connects to.

1. Navigate to your local directory of this cloned repository
2. Navigate to the src/components/misc folder and open the apiRequests.js file
3. On line 3 where you would see const ```const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL;```, replace ```process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL;``` with the url of your back-end server that you would have setup following the ["Setting up The Back-End"](https://github.com/Aaron-RN/ROR-GDT-Assessment) Guide  
**b)** Or if you are using a hosting server with the option for environment variables as I am, you can simple place the URL of your API in an environment variables called REACT_APP_API_URL
